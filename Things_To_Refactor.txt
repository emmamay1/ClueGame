Board:
	Think about where we want HashSet initialization. Right now some are in certain functions and some are in initialize, which seems weird. Initialize everything right away, and clear if necessary
	Lines 71-78: add comments comparing string formatting to what our functions are doing
	Line 69/90: add surpress warning (if nothing else to do)
	Line 167/186: add comment explaining how logic works and what it is doing
	Rename all cols to columns (in board and boardcell)
	Line 220: rename i and j to row and column

BoardCell:
	Line 33: add comment to explain set
	Add enum type for boardcell, remove awkward booleans for walkway etc.

BadConfigFormatException: 
	line 15: refactor String s to String errorMessage
